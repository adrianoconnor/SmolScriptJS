/*
Description: Test that native methods on String work as expected

This test shows how to call the .length property on String, which is handled by native code
in the object class that defines the type.

Steps:
- Run
- Expect global l to be number 11
- Expect global s to be string Test String
- Expect global z to be undefined
*/

var s = "Test String";
var l = s.length;
//var p = s.indexOf('String');
var x = t * 2; // Why doesn't this throw?! /* */ // **//
//var r = s.replace('Test', 'Replace');
