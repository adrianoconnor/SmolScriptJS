# SmolScript

SmolScript is a JS-like language that runs inside a tiny stack based VM, in JavaScript. It is designed to be relatively easy to implement in other languages (there is also a .net version, an almost-complete Python version and the beginnings of a Java version), but each implementation is going to be different because we rely on the host language's features to provide certain primitives and base functionality (for example, each version is totally dependent on the host language implementation of strings, numbers, regexes etc), so while we try to make it highly consistent and the language test suite is shared across languages, in .net there are going to be small differences to JavaScript and vice versa. This choice allows SmolScript itself be *very* small and limits our 'blast' radius for the things that might introduce vulnerabilities and other headaches.

A demo website (that runs this Javascript version in the browser) is available at https://smolscript.org/interactive-demo. It is very basic, but it lets you view the compiled program along with the VM's internal state as you step through the debugger.

## Is this just another AI generated side-project?

No. In 2026 there has been an explosion of side-projects like this as people used AI coding agents to scratch their many coding itches. This is not one of those projects, 90% of the code was written (by hand) in 2023, and more recent changes are also all still hand-coded. I wanted to fully understand how programming languages work, not just try and race to the end-result, so I will continue to maintain it by hand.

## Background

The primary goals of this project are:

1. For me (Adrian O'Connor) to learn how programming languages are implemented, and get a deeper understanding of how compilers and virtual machines work. It's just an itch I've been wanting to scratch since I started programming many years ago.
2. Build a potentially useful Javascript-like runtime that could be used as embedded scripting language inside other applications. For example, it could be used for adding macros to an existing application, or running code in a zero trust environment, or building an educational IDE for teaching programming concepts in an interactive way.
3. It is designed to be secure (but there are no guarantees). The run-time is intended to be completely sandboxed from the host application, making it somewhat suitable for running untrusted code. Smol scripts can't access any of the host language's features or resources, but you can create custom bridges using functions and delegates, so you can expose whatever you need. Please note that we make no guarantees about security.

One goal we do not have is performance. This is probably the slowest Javascript-like engine you will ever use! We have absolutely prioritised simplicity of code over high performance.

Even though we've based SmolScript on Javascript, it is not anywhere near feature parity and never will be, this really is just a little side project. However, whenever we add new features we always start by looking at how Javascript does it, and over time that has become our defacto approach.

## Status

What is built so far:

* A working 'byte-code' compiler (including hand rolled scanner and parser) that supports most of the basic language features you'd expect in a tiny Javascript-like language
* A stack-based Virtual Machine that supports break points and step through and a small degree of observability (with more to come)
* An easy way to expose custom functions from js using simple closures to wrap the native code (no need for adding new types/interfaces) that automatically deal with type coercion
* A test suite that I think almost covers the entire language -- we've built this in a way that the test files can be shared across all smol implementations (but I'm still moving stuff from the early .net development unit tests to the shared suite so that's not complete)

The byte-code compiler does not produce byte-code at all, all of the instructions are actually objects in the host language, but it doesn't matter because it doesn't generate binaries, they're just an intermediate step.

In terms of language features, we currently have:

* Var only for variables (but in smol var works more like let)
* Flow control
* Basic Arrays
* Basic Dictionarys (plain Objects, inheritence/prototype is not really there)
* Classes (no inheritence)
* First class functions
* Basic Try/Catch
* Regex
* => syntax
* JS style handling of optional semicolons
* Ability to define native functions in JS and call them from SmolScript...
* Ability to call SmolScript functions from JS (and return the result)

On our list of things that we think we want to add:

* for ... in
* JSON, Console, Date added to the standard library
* Pass JS/JSON objects in as paramters and use reflection to access them dynamicly
* Better try/catch
* Exposing tokens/line numbers for compiled source (we've mostly done this, but in a way that I don't think professional compiler engineers would approve of)
* Better compiler errors

What is not on our roadmap right now:

* Modules
* Async/await
* file, network, database etc -- for that we expect you to use native custom functions exposed to your VM (this is how we make it secure!)

## I want to use it in my project!

No, it is not ready, it is not a commercial project and I don't have time to support it.

Also, it is incredibly slow -- probably the least optimised language you've ever used. I really have made no effort to optimise, because I want to keep the code simple. In benchmarks it is typically 3-4 times slower than NodeJS for small scripts, and as the code gets more complicated or the run-time gets longer, the gap widens.

Also, it is a bit messy. Unit tests prove it works as designed, but I made some questionable choices due to lack of experience.

I do hope somebody will find this interesting at least. I've certainly enjoyed creating it, and I've learned so much. Maybe one day it will be actually useful.
